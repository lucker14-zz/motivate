This cooperation has provided us with a completely new insight into the soul of our company. It has helped us better understand our colleagues and their view on Buřinka as an employer, and identify what our employees value and what should be changed.  Jan and Jiří even helped us define basic principles of a new corporate culture and its implementation in the company. What do I especially appreciate in this cooperation? Honest and practical approach, open, constructive and inspiring discussion and sharing of experiences on similar projects in other companies.”

references_p2: „We have been working with Jiří Žižka and Jan Šmída at Česka pojišťovna since the end of 2012 on the project entitled Employer Branding. This project, and in particular the contribution of both of our external colleagues from Motivate have provided us with comprehensive information on factors that motivate our insurance agents, respectively de-motivate, in their work at Česka pojišťovna, and, last but not least, also the very interesting findings regarding the motivation of applicants for employment at our company. Together with our colleagues, we are now preparing other concrete steps by which we could react to the findings of the project, and simultaneously also further strengthen the image of Česka pojišťovna as an attractive, perceptive and stable employer.”

references_p3: „After my experience with the Motivate Consulting in the Operations division of Česká spořitelna, I have decided to use their services in regards to planned changes in the Retail Division of ČS as well. The in-depth survey carried out across the entire branch network helped all of us better understand the current state of affairs, problems, and everyday concerns that our employees on the front line are faced with. We were impressed not only by the complexity and depth of the identified topics, but also the particularly accurate and comprehensible analysis of problems outlined in the fields of processing, motivation, and the cooperation of bank divisions, as well as the view of our employees and the brand image of the company they work for. For me, this view was particularly valuable at a time when I held the position of newly appointed Director of the Retail Division and had to quickly and accurately navigate the current situation while making quick and correct decisions.”

He managed to map the best international practices, analyze the management of employee insights and then based on that propose an optimal process for building the new brand of the employer and communication concept of the ČEZ Group for potential applicants and employees. Based on this project a significant shift in the field of engagement between existing employees occurred and the ČEZ Group has repeatedly begun to place itself in the highest rankings of the most desired employers in surveys amongst university students.”

Na základě hloubkového průzkumu mezi zaměstnanci i potenciálními uchazeči dokázali přesně analyzovat hlavní motivátory našich zaměstnanců a zformulovat hlavní pilíře strategie Employer brandu značky Billa. Zároveň dokázali identifikovat zdroje nespokojenosti našich zaměstnanců a na základě facilitace změnového workshopu s top managementem firmy navrhnout konkrétní kroky ke snížení fluktuace a zvýšení atraktivity naší značky pro potenciální uchazeče o práci. Vážíme si jejich pro klientského přístupu po celou dobu vedení projektu, jakož i srozumitelných výstupů, které nám pomohli ve formulaci finálních rozhodnutí nejen v oblasti HR.”

In my position as HR Director for the Ahold stores in Czech Republic I was leading this project. Jiri Zizka headed the team on agency side. I enjoyed working with Jiri for reason that we did not only reach a great results which really fitted the organization and what we stand for, but as well for the ownership he showed in pulling this off together. Jiri was not afraid to challenge our assumptions based on his own insights and insights gained from our employees during the interviews and observations.”

references_p7: „Is there another way to learn more about how people in your team are doing, what their needs are, what bothers them and what makes them fun than asking them directly? Though, only questioning cannot always provide an accurate picture of all issues concerning your employees and we are often unable to identify potential discontent due to our professional blindness. Through in-depth interviews with our employees, Motivate has helped us set the mirror properly. Outputs from the survey have contributed to the decision where to focus our energy and attention. We believe that the more enthusiastic and committed employees we have, the better the Česká spořitelna will do. The collaboration with the tandem of Jiří Žižka and Jan Šmída was excellent and professional. The quality outputs showed clearly their extensive knowledge and experience in the field of in-depth surveys. Great job, guys!”

A deep survey performed among employees Jiří Žižka and Jan Šmíd, enabled us to comprehensibly and materially answer all of our questions and simultaneously reveal additional subjects we had not considered until that time in connection with the presentation of the employer brand. In particular, we value the precise analysis of the issue and the ability to infer from this analysis clear strategic recommendations and proposed solutions for the area of HR and communication. ”

popup_p1_name: 'Jan Šmída'
popup_p1_position: Managing Partner
popup_p1_body: During my entire professional career, I worked in field of communication, both in terms of brands, products or services. Through my work for multinational corporations in FMCG, I had the opportunity to learn the needs of customers of different age groups in different stages of life, different locations, on four different continents. I have always liked to look for common denominators and analyze the motivators and motivations governing people when they are deciding whether buy selected product or in their work and personal life. That is something I decided to dedicate fulltime in our own company Motivate. Even after hundreds of in-depth interviews with employees of large corporations and small companies on the subject of their motivation it still fascinates me how simple motives can often be a source of great motivation or demotivation contrary, in work life. In my work, I not only try to find these sources, but also to use them to increase employee motivation and satisfaction. Because only motivated employees can bring long-term sustainable growth to their employer.
popup_p2_name: 'Jiří Žiška'
popup_p2_position: Senior Partner
popup_p2_body: During almost 20 years spent in the field of advertising, I had the rare opportunity to work for more than 30 brands. This experience allowed me to see the field of advertising and marketing communication in its entire development, including all of the positives and negatives. Over the years I had the good fortune of being able to work on many interesting projects, whether it was the re-branding of large brands, merger of company cultures, repositioning of existing brands or introduction of completely new products or categories to the market. The number of different brands and projects gave me the opportunity to compare find out what successful brands and companies have in common and how they differ from the successful ones. In my opinion, it is mainly about the unique ability to listen to and correctly analyze  needs of clients and their employees. And that is what led me years ago to the new field of internal and HR communications and to develop a methodology and process Employer Branding – tools for finding out employee insights and finding ways to increase company operations thanks to an improvement in company culture.

popup_p3_position: Associate Senior Partner
popup_p3_body: When I bought the then defunct brand Multiservis in 1993 with my partners, nobody would have believed that it would become the largest player in the credit market. When I established a new bank for GE in 1998, GE Capital, on an already divided market at the time, nobody believed it would become the 4th largest bank in the Czech Republic and the 2nd largest provider of loans… and I end up as the first „Eastern European” in the top management of GE Capital in Stamford. In 2003, when I took over the management of the, at the time, rather small Alfa Bank in Moscow, even I had no idea that it would grow 10 times in five years and become the largest privately owned bank in Russia, which will be evaluated by international media as the best bank in Russia for three consecutive years. All of these stories have one thing in common – wonderful people connected by a vision, desire and common values. In the beginning there was one belief, accompanied by positive energy, diligence of the entire implementation team, but mainly a shared clear vision of where to go and how to achieve it. The main tool along this journey was always a change in company culture, so that each employee at each level of management knew, understood and above all believed in where we were going and how… and actively participated in the creation of our journey. And thus MOTIVATE…

popup_p4_position: Quantitative research
popup_p4_body: I have been devoted to quantitative research and consultancy since the mid-1990s, that is, since the time my studies of sociology at the Faculty of Social Sciences at Charles University. At that time I was acquiring my first experiences as an analyst and consultant in collaboration with a number of companies in the field of market research, PR and trainings. In 1999, I worked as Head of Research at the advertising agency Mark / BBDO. From 2000 to 2006 I worked as country manager of international research for the companies INRA and IPSOS, where I had the opportunity to work for a number of leading companies operating on the Czech market (such as Skoda Auto, P & G, Kraft, Danone, Wrigley and Komercni banka). In 2006, I became one of the founders and director of Empirica, which is dedicated to marketing, media, and political and social research. In the field of measuring public value and preparing pre-election surveys I have long worked as an external consultant with Czech Television. I am a member of the ESOMAR association.

popup_p5_position: Quantitative research
popup_p5_body: „Oblasti marketingového výzkumu a komunikace se věnuji celou svou profesní kariéru. Prvních 8 let jsem měla možnost poznat oblast marketingového výzkumu jak z pohledu velké mezinárodní výzkumné agentury, tak z pohledu největšího telekomunikačního operátora na trhu. Druhých 8 let jsem strávila ve dvou prestižních reklamních agenturách, abych si osvojila zkušenosti v plánování strategie komunikace a dennodenní péče o zajímavé značky v nejrůznějších segmentech. Osvojila jsem si díky tomu komplexní vhled do tématu získávání zákaznických insightů a následné práce s nimi při tvorbě komunikační strategie. Mnohokrát jsem zažila úskalí tohoto procesu od samého počátku až po finální realizaci reklamních kampaní. Proto vím, jak velmi důležité je v samém počátku správně pochopit reálné potřeby a motivaci zákazníka. A tomu se dále věnuji i ve společnosti Motivate.“

popup_p6_position: Human Garden – HR Consulting
popup_p6_body: I have been dedicated to the area of human resources and personal motivation at a theoretical as well as practical level at various tiers of management. My studies in this field at Nottingham Trent University, London Business School, Newcastle College and Erickson College greatly contributed to my development. Nevertheless, it was actually the many years of experience in resolving day-to-day situations arising in the operations of multi-national corporations, whether GE Money or T-Mobile, where I worked for the last 9 years of my corporate career as HR manager, which had the greatest impact on my knowledge of HR. I had the opportunity to compare work in this field on the Czech and Slovak markets, as well as in Germany and elsewhere abroad (Deutsche Telecom, GE Europe). I am convinced that a person is not born as an HR professional, but can become one, and not by studying the problems, joys and woes of employees of large corporations, but by experiencing these firsthand in the corporate environment. Only in this way can one evaluate all of the pitfalls and find appropriate and sensitive solutions for the company and for its employees. The work of my team has been recognized with a number of awards, such as Best Personnel Project of the Year and Best Employer or HR Personality of the Year. Awards are gratifying, but for me the best form of recognition has always been and will be the feeling that through my work I am contributing to the improvement of the workplace and culture of the given corporation, making its work environment healthier and more pleasant for all employees. This is what I have been striving for over the past 3 years in my company Human Garden, where we provide services in the area of HR, coaching, building corporate culture and the environment of a healthy company.

popup_p7_position: Internal Communication
popup_p7_body: Within nearly twenty years of work in field of communications, I had many occasions to be part of big things. One of those opportunities I got at GE, where I was responsible as Internal Communication manager for GE Capital's rebranding to GE Money. Our task was to reposition the brand, so employee engagement played a big role. The CEZ Group, with whom my nine-year career spans, has enabled me to work on several exceptional projects. After CEZ went through one of the biggest reorganizations in the Central European market, I had to build a complex internal communication and with the top management of the company to change the corporate culture. For few years later, there was a problem of lack of technical professions and my job was to build a strong Employer Brand of the company. Few years later, I led the Customer Experience project with the aim of setting up pro-customer processes and build evaluation and motivational system of employees based on customer experience. I have been convinced many times about the benefits of internal communication and employee engagement in favor of company goals and results, I was at the beginning of Institute of Internal Communications and the setting of standards in that field in the Czech Republic.
